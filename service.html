                <p  style="color: grey; font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: 1px;" >The commerce stream is altogether a different world as students entering into it hardly have any
                knowledge about the subjects or what commerce is all about. Hence, class 10+1 is a very crucial
                and an important academic class. It is the class in which the foundation is laid down and concepts
                are introduced, which are tested throughout your professional studies.
                GK Institute of Commerce ensures proper conceptual clarity and builds a proper and firm base.
                Students are made familiar and comfortable with the basics as various competitive exams test you
                at the basic level. Also, 10+1 is the building block not only for 10+2 class but throughout his course
                of education & career . Students of all the boards (CBSE, ICSE and PSEB) are taught here. Provisions
                are made to cover the little difference in their subjects. The goal of the institute is to imbibe in students a love for learning commerce and to inculcate in
                them a desire to excel at every level. The Institute also aims at equipping the students with the
                intellectual and practical skills that are necessary to face the inevitable challenges in the future.
                Personal attention is given to each and every student. Regular group discussions and revision tests
                are conducted. Self-evaluation is also promoted. Weekly test is given and marks are conveyed to
                the Parent / Guardian.

                  decide the future career of a student. The 12th class board marks are the gateway to the best
                  commerce colleges of the region as well as the country. A student can study in an elite commerce
                  college if he scores at least 96%.
                  But, what if you don’t score 96%? A college is not the only option. There are various professional
                  courses that a student can choose from such as CA, CS, CMA, CLAT etc. We offer coaching for
                  professional courses as well. The students need to put in their maximum efforts and give their best performance. The reins of
                  their future are in their own hands and The GK Institute provides proper guidance as to how to
                  move them. We ensure that conceptual clarity is improved and students have proper
                  understanding and deep knowledge. To score well in this class is a dream that we help in
                  materializing.
                  Quick, yet proper syllabus completion; regular revision, tests and doubt sessions; practical
                  experience along with theoretical mastery; educative, competitive and a friendly environment: is
                  what the institute provides. Weekly test is given and marks are conveyed to the Parent / Guardian.</p>
