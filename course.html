        <p id="incr">The commerce stream is altogether a different world as students entering into it hardly have any
          knowledge about the subjects or what commerce is all about. Hence, class 10+1 is a very crucial and an
          important academic class. It is the class in which the foundation is laid down and concepts are introduced,
          which are tested throughout your professional studies. GK Institute of Commerce ensures proper conceptual
          clarity and builds a proper and firm base. Students are made familiar and comfortable with the basics as
          various competitive exams test you at the basic level. Also, 10+1 is the building block not only for 10+2
          class but throughout his course of education & career . Students of all the boards (CBSE, ICSE and PSEB) are
          taught here. Provisions are made to cover the little difference in their subjects. The goal of the institute
          is to imbibe in students a love for learning commerce and to inculcate in them a desire to excel at every
          level. The Institute also aims at equipping the students with the intellectual and practical skills that are
          necessary to face the inevitable challenges in the future. Personal attention is given to each and every
          student. Regular group discussions and revision tests are conducted. Self-evaluation is also promoted. Weekly
          test is given and marks are conveyed to the Parent / Guardian.</p>

        <h3 id="decor">10+2 COMMERCE</h3>
        <p id="incr">The class of 10+2 is the most important class for a commerce student. The marks scored in this
          class decide the future career of a student. The 12th class board marks are the gateway to the best commerce
          colleges of the region as well as the country. A student can study in an elite commerce college if he scores
          at least 96%. But, what if you don’t score 96%? A college is not the only option. There are various
          professional courses that a student can choose from such as CA, CS, CMA, CLAT etc. We offer coaching for
          professional courses as well. The students need to put in their maximum efforts and give their best
          performance. The reins of their future are in their own hands and The GK Institute provides proper guidance as
          to how to move them. We ensure that conceptual clarity is improved and students have proper understanding and
          deep knowledge. To score well in this class is a dream that we help in materializing. Quick, yet proper
          syllabus completion; regular revision, tests and doubt sessions; practical experience along with theoretical
          mastery; educative, competitive and a friendly environment: is what the institute provides. Weekly test is
          given and marks are conveyed to the Parent / Guardian.</p>

        <h3 id="decor">CA Foundation</h3>
        <p id="incr">These days many students are losing out interest in engineering & medical due to various reasons
          and are looking out for other options. CA-Foundation (CA-CPT) is definitely a buzzword in today’s world.
          Demand for certified accountants is sensed well in the industry. Students attracted towards CA-Foundation
          (CA-CPT) course tend to lead their career path as Chartered Accountants (CA) / Cost & Management Accountants
          (CMA) / Company Secretary (CS). Student’s interest in being an accounting professional is trending with good
          job openings in the market and handsome pay packets. In recent years, there is tremendous progress in scores
          achieved by the students in all India CA-Foundation (CA-CPT) exams. With high growth rate, students are
          looking for more accurate information and resources available near to them to know more about CA-Foundation
          curriculum. CA Foundation (CA-CPT) is an entry level examination leading to CA. A 12th Class pass student can
          take up this course.</p>

        <p id="incr">CA Intermediate formerly called or popularly known as CA-IPCC is the Second level of the
          prestigious Chartered Accountancy Course which we know has 3 levels of rigorous examinations. The CA-Inter
          exam is taken after passing the 1st level exam i.e. CA-Foundation and nine months of study. As the level of
          competition and toughness of exam is much more in CA-Inter level, efforts of GK Faculty are also doubled for
          this level. With regular tests and complete conceptual clarity we prepare our students for all kind of
